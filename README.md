Summary:
Giver is an open-access giving marketplace which tracks the impact of your charitable contributions via transactions, and alerts you along the way. The mission of Giver is to encourage charitable giving by improving the Giver experience.

How it Works:
Charitable organizations will be allowed to create accounts on our front-end once they attach a virtual signature to our honor code, which will be displayed on the site.
Organizations (Users) will have some flexibility to customize the look and feel of their donation pages, though much of the interface will be streamlined for Giver convenience (analogous to a Spotify model).
Users will have the option to introduce loyalty access for Givers who contribute at some predefined level (e.g. access to virtual meetings, input on spending decisions, etc.).
Giver, the platform, will not charge any fees.


Limitations:
NFT is structured to create a new vault for each user donation is enefficient if more users were to use the Giver. There is no current connection betweeen Wallets at the moment. Another limitation is once the charity converts the tokens into USD, tracking the accuracy of transactions becomes more difficult and depends if the charity is honest to users. 

Future Additions:
Front end application making the Giver user friendly to public. Track transactions from the time donation is received until donation is exchanged for a good or service.
